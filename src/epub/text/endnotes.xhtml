					<p>When I wrote these lines, Joseph Rouletabille was eighteen years of age⁠—and he spoke of his “youth.” I have kept the text of my friend, but I inform the reader here that the episode of the mystery of The Yellow Room has no connection with that of the perfume of the lady in black. It is not my fault if, in the document which I have cited, Rouletabille thought fit to refer to his childhood. <a href="chapter-17.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩︎</a></p>
