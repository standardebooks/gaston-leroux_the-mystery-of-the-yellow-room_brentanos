	<title>A plan of the upper floor of the château, showing rooms, doors, and windows. The right wing of the château is ell-shaped, with the main hallway labelled “Right Gallery”, and the perpendicular hallway labelled “Winding Gallery”. At one end of the right gallery is the door to Mademoiselle Stangerson’s anteroom, which in turn leads into her bedroom. Outside this door is a dot marked with a “3”, and a bedroom window is marked with a “4”. At the far end of the right gallery is a dot marked with a “2”. The winding gallery splits off from the right gallery near the middle, and goes past two rooms labelled as “Rouletabille’s Room” and “Frédéric Larsan’s Room”. At the far end of the winding gallery is a dot marked with a “1”, and a window marked with a “5”. Just outside this window is a semicircular area labelled with a “6”.</title>
